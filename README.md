# Snack-Streaming 

Snack-Streaming is an idea for an alternative streaming service that allows users to save money by curating their content. 
Users can hand-pick a selection of movies to watch on a bi-weekly basis, pay a fraction of most subscription prices, and receive discounts for having niche interests.  

The front-end for this idea was made as a project with React and Bootstrap.
The authentication for login and sign up was made with Firebase.

Presented as a Demo Night Project for CUNY Tech Prep
